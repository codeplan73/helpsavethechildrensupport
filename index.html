                    Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe, after Russia, and has an estimated population of 44
                    million. Sadly, children in Eastern Ukraine have grown up in conflict for the past eight years,
                    enduring violence, shelling and being displaced from their homes. Today, fighting in Ukraine has
                    forced children and families to seek refuge in neighboring countries, with more than 4 million
                    people having now crossed the borders.
